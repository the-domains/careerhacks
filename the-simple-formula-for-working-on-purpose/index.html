<p>Working on purpose doesn’t need to be overly complicated. You don’t need to spend thousands of dollars on a personal retreat, you don’t need to spend a lifetime pursuing enlightenment and you don’t need to quit your job, risk everything and follow your dream.</p><p>Living on purpose is about paying attention to what is important to you and focusing your intention to go after it.</p><p>To discover your purpose you just need to take 15 to 20 minutes and answer these four simple questions: </p><p>1) Do you love the work that you do?</p><p>When you think about the work that you do: Do you look forward to each workday? Does your work feed you the required energy to get through the ups and downs of each day? Does your work fill you with passion? If you didn’t have to worry about money, would you still do this work?</p><p>If you answered anything but an extraordinary YES to this question you need to _shift your mind_.</p><p>2) Are you really really good at the work that you do?</p><p>When you think about the work that you do: Does it bring out your best work? Does it leverage your key strengths? Does it allow you to do deep work? Are you easily able to slide into flow? Are you able to identify the unique combination of skills, strengths and capabilities that you bring to your work?</p><p>If you answered anything but an extraordinary YES to this question you need to _own your learning_.</p><p>3) Will someone pay you to do this work? 

When you think about the work that you do: Are you clear on the value that you provide? Are employers or customers willing to part with their money to pay you to perform the work that you do? Are you aware of the trends in your industry? Is the demand for the work that you do on the rise?</p><p>If you answered anything but an extraordinary YES to this question you need to _discover your value_.</p><p>4) Are you making the world a better place?</p><p>When you think about the work that you do: Are you making a difference in the lives of other people? Are you contributing to the greater good? Are you coaching your team to be better? Is the end product of your work improving the lives of others? If you have been fortunate enough to achieve success, are giving back to those in need?</p><p>If you answered anything but an extraordinary YES to this question you need to _find your why_.</p><p>When you pay attention to the answers from these 4 simple questions you will begin to discover that career sweet spot where the questions overlap. 
</p><p>When you set your intention to make the minor shifts in your thinking and behaviours to move into that sweet spot, you will be well on your way to working on purpose.</p><p>I first discovered this model in a presentation by Ryan Allis the founder of Hive. You can find it on slide 60 of the 1285 page presentation where Ryan discusses his lessons from his 20’s.
